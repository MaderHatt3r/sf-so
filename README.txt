SF·SO is a kick-start Office Add-In implementing the "Save Frequently. Save Often." concept. At its core it is designed to automatically save a copy of your documents to your Google Drive account. Each upload by default will save to the same Google Drive file, but to a different revision, viewable by opening the document and clicking File->Manage Revisions. Enable options to automatically save the document based on a time interval you specify so that even if your dog eats your computer, you will still have your homework.
But why stop there. Since we are saving into a cloud, why not take advantage of the cloud.
-Have your files available anywhere. Don't worry about forgetting to put it on a flash drive or which copy you have.
-Only maintain one copy of a document from computer-to-computer
--Update an out-of-date document to match the latest revision
--Work on the document at the same time in two locations. Merge changes made by others and choose to accept or reject them one change at a time.
--Use Google Drive's sharing options to collaborate on documents without having to maintain multiple copies.
